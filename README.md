# First-UE4-Game
The first game I built in UE4 as part of a lesson. Tought the basics and some more complicated topics of UE4 development.

## Features
A very simple combat system, the ability to pick up weapons, take and deal damage, get money, etc.
Nothing super fancy, but still should all work together fairly well.
